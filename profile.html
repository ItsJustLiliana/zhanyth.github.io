        <p class="text">Hi, I'm Marijn. A simple guy living in the Netherlands. I'm the oldest sibling of the<br />
          three living with two fluffy cats.</p>
        <div class="div1">
          <p class="text">I study HBO-ICT at <b>HZ University of Applied Sciences</b> in Middelburg.<br />
            Before this I went to primary school at the Sint Willibrordusschool and highschool<br />
            at the Reynaertcollege, both of which are in Hulst. I finished my HAVO NT/NG<br />
            (Senior general secondary education) in June 2024 with a beautifull diploma and<br />
            immediately started studieng at HZ without a year break. I have been eager with<br />
            computer science since I was 8 years old. Always loved playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 3<br />
            and Minecraft on the dekstop at home. I also (sort of) managed the dekstop pc's at my<br />
            primary school which I was very proud of at the time. I knew that computers were my<br />
            thing and that I'd make it my job in the future. Fast forward to now I think past<br />
            me would be very proud of what I have achieved so far.

            <p class="text">I play fieldhockey at MHC Rapide in team Men's 1 (Heren 1). Training every week<br />
              and spending time with the team is one of the best social activities I spend my time<br />
              with. Most of the time going out after training to drink some beer with the lads.<br />
              The matches are always fun before, during and after aswell.
