        <p class="text"><b>Hi, I'm Marijn.</b>
          <br />A simple guy living in the Netherlands with two fluffy cats.

        <p class="text">I study HBO-ICT at <b>HZ University of Applied Sciences</b> in Middelburg.
          <br />Before this I went to primary school at the Sint Willibrordusschool and highschool
          <br />at the Reynaertcollege, both of which are in Hulst. I finished my HAVO NT/NG
          <br />(Senior general secondary education) in June 2024 with a beautifull diploma and
          <br />immediately started studying at HZ without a year break.

        <p class="text">I have been eager with computer science since I was 8 years old. Always loved playing
          <br />Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and Minecraft on the dekstop at home. I also (sort of) managed
          <br />the dekstop pc's at my primary school which I was very proud of at the time. I knew
          <br />that computers were my thing and that I'd make it my job in the future. Fast forward
          <br />to now I think past me would be very proud of what I have achieved so far.

        <p class="text">I play fieldhockey at MHC Rapide in the Men's 1 (Heren 1) team. Training every week
          <br />and spending time with the team is one of the best social activities I want to be a part of.
          <br />Most of the time going out after training to drink some beer with the lads. The matches
          <br />are always fun before, during and after aswell. Every week we train with the older/previous
          <br />team members aswell who still teach us, the newer generation, some of their skills.
        </p>

        <p class="text">In my free time I love to play and produce music. Grabbing my acoustic or electric
          <br />guitar to record/cover a song is what I love to do. Music in general is one of my biggest
          <br />passions. I cannot live a day without music, always need to have earbuds in, a headphone on
          <br />or just blasting music through the huge sound system in my room.
          <br />My favorite genre's are hardstyle, rawstyle, hardcore, frenchcore, uptempo and techno.
          <br />Though I can also listen to most of the other genre's (anything but rap or hiphop).
          <br />My favourite artist(s) would be Da Tweekaz.
