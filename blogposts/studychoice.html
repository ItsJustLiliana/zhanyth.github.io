                <h2>Study Choice</h2>
                <p class="blogpagetext">From a young age I already knew what I would like to become in the future. It
                    was clear to
                    <br />me what my path was and how I would be walking it. It started with turning on and off
                    <br />computers at primary school and even on (request) login into my teachers computer before they
                    <br />arrived in the classroom. After that on high school I started doing some messing with the
                    <br />schoolcomputers which was a lot of fun.
                    <br /><br />
                    Now I am incredibly interested in the whole science behind it and how computers operate. I've been
                    <br />able to dissasemble some pc's and take a look inside them. All the little components I wanted
                    <br />to keep were still a motivation to this day to find out what each of them does.
                    <br /><br />
                    I got a Nintendo 3DS since I was 8 years old and these days it doesn't have any support anymore
                    <br />which means there are no update to the software, new games being published and all official
                    <br />online services have been taken down which is all the more reason to look into modding your
                    <br />3DS. One day I stumbled upon a video of someone explaining how to mod your 3DS and I was
                    <br />immediately interested. It took a bit of time to make it happen on my own console, but
                    <br />eventually I made it happen. Now I want to know how all of this is even possible, because
                    <br />if you make one wrong move your console might get bricked and unable to be restored. It is
                    <br />so interesting how all of it works.
